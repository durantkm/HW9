Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?

-One class would be called NationalPark


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?

-The NationalPark class would take an html-formatted string as an input


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?

One instance of this class will represent a monument/national park and all of the information related to it

* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

At least 3 instance variables I'd use for this class would be: 

street_address: which would hold the location of the monument/park's visiting center
description: which will hold the description for the park/monument
phone_number: which will hold the phone number for the park/monument


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
The name would be __str__

- What will the method do?
The __str__ method will allow a message comprised of the information from the instance variables to be returned when the class instance is assigned to a variable or passed through the print statement 

- Will it take any additional input? 
It will not need additional input

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It would return a string when the class instance is assigned to a variable or passed through the print statement.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

This method allows for the information within a class to be printed for a user to see which could be helpful for testing.

ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
get_address method

- What will the method do?
This method will return the value from the street_address instance value

- Will it take any additional input? 
It will not need additional input

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return the value from the street_address

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
Allows the program to access the particular class's  instances street address information which could be used later within the program

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
The tables will be:
Parks
States
Artile


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)

Parks:
Park_id--DEFAULT INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
Park_Name--TEXT
State--TEXT
Description--TEXT

States:
State_id--DEFAULT INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
State--TEXT
Abbrv--TEXT
Avg_temp--INTEGER

Articles:
Article_id--DEEFAULT INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
Title--TEXT
Article_Txt--TEXT



* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

1. I would make a query to check what park/monument have an avg_temp above 75 by joining the states and parks table

2. I would make a query to get each states abbreviation

* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 

list comprehension

dictionary comprehension

* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
list comprehension: I will be creating a list of the url's that will allow me to go to each state's webpage about their monument/parks.

Dictionary comprehension: I will create a dictionary that should hold the state as a key and the list of monument/parks associated with that state as the value.

* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
